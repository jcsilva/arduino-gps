PARA CRIAR UMA TABELA NO BANCO POSGRESQL DO HEROKU
--------------------------------------------------

First you login to your heroku account
Then you go to databases section 3 There you create a database by clicking on Create Database
Then your heroku database is created and you get to see its details such as

host = ...

database = ...

User = ...

Port = ...

Password = ...

Now Connect to the database using PostgreSQL’s interactive terminal client.

If you don't have it already installed then you’ll have to turn to your platform’s package management suite (e.g. on Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install postgresql-client) or go to postgresql.org, where you’ll find available for download pre-built binary packages suitable for FreeBSD, Linux, Mac, Solaris and Windows, as well as other installation options.

To connect, call psql with the -h option to specify the server’s hostname, -U to specify     the username, and then the database name:

root@yogesh-System-model:~# psql -h [**Host Name**] -U [**User Name**] [**database Name**]
    Password for user hdwvhbehqlishy: ********
    psql (8.4.9, server 9.0.5)
    WARNING: psql version 8.4, server version 9.0.
     Some psql features might not work.
    SSL connection (cipher: DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA, bits: 256)
    Type "help" for help.


df7r55a12o64m4==> CREATE TABLE [Table_name](your_id SERIAL, Name text, Address text);
NO MEU CASO: 
create table gpspos (id serial not null primary key, lat_coord varchar(20), lon_coord varchar(20));

That will create a table....

I know owner of this question has already solved the problem but still posting this answer for future references....
